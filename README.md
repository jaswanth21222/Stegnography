Steganography is the art and science of hiding information within another medium, making the hidden data undetectable to anyone who does not know what to look for. The term originates from the Greek words "steganos" (meaning "covered") and "graphein" (meaning "to write"). This technique has been used for centuries, dating back to ancient civilizations that employed various methods to conceal messages and protect sensitive information. Today, steganography has evolved into a sophisticated digital practice, often used alongside encryption to ensure the security and confidentiality of data.

The primary goal of steganography is to embed a secret message within a carrier file, such as an image, audio, video, or text, without significantly altering the appearance or function of the carrier. Unlike encryption, which scrambles the content of a message to make it unreadable without the proper decryption key, steganography seeks to hide the very existence of the message. This dual-layer approach can be particularly effective in scenarios where the mere presence of an encrypted message might arouse suspicion.

One of the most common forms of digital steganography is image steganography. In this method, the secret message is embedded within the pixel values of an image file. The least significant bit (LSB) technique is often used, where the least significant bits of the pixel values are modified to encode the hidden data. Since the changes are minimal, they are imperceptible to the human eye, and the image appears unchanged. Advanced algorithms can further enhance the security and robustness of this technique, making it difficult for attackers to detect or extract the hidden message.

Audio steganography is another popular method, where the secret message is embedded within an audio file. Similar to image steganography, the LSB technique can be used to modify the least significant bits of the audio samples. Additionally, more sophisticated methods, such as phase coding and spread spectrum, can be employed to achieve higher levels of security and transparency. These techniques leverage the properties of human auditory perception to ensure that the hidden message remains undetectable.

Video steganography builds on the principles of image and audio steganography, embedding secret messages within the frames of a video file. This method offers several advantages, including larger payload capacity and increased security due to the dynamic nature of video content. By distributing the hidden data across multiple frames, video steganography can achieve higher levels of robustness and resistance to detection.
